#Welcome to Macaron Project 1-TodoList

Hello and welcome to my Macaron TodoList. This TodoList was designed with simplicity in use and have clean interface.

##Prototype 
Before I started anything, I drew some prototype as to how my Todo List would work before I started coding. Initially I was thinking of putting all the button on one side. But after a few testing with different layout, I ultimately  did change up some design aspect when I was doing the actual testing.
