This is not the greatest to-do list app in the world, this is just a tribute.

The floating action button is the only element on the main screen which the user can access. On click, this will bring up an alert dialog which prompts the user to assign a title to the list they are about to create.

The user has the ability to create a list without a title since not every list of items you create will need to be categorized. The only field that is required in a to-do list is the title of each item. This way, the user is able to create anything from a single list with only titles for items, all the way to multiple complex lists with each item containing a title and description.
