10-18:

Initial concept thoughts - create a lightweight, intuitive to-do list app with a splsh screen, a ListVIew of recently edited notes (actionable), a sidebar settings menu (this is where access to the full list of notes will be), a contrast colored FAB with both short and long press actions, checkboxes to mark items as "done" and lists as "accomplished" and marked for deletion in 5 days. 

Item Features (by section):

        Recently Edited Notes - the (1-5) most recent notes made. Actionable to edit or mark for deletion.
                    Sub section for notes that are due to be deleted.
        
        Sidebar Menu - Settings for push notification reminders, access to 'My Lists'(?),
